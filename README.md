# SpiderTools

Create a python wrapper around the following SpiderLab tools:

- [x] [Tacoco](https://github.com/spideruci/tacoco)
- [ ] [Blinky-Core](https://github.com/spideruci/blinky-core)

The goal is to allow us to write experiments in Python without having to relearn how each tool exactly works.

## Install
- The SpiderTools can be installed using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajdreef/spidertools
cd spidertools
pip3 install -e .
```

To make use of the wrappers the tools itself need to be installed as well, see the documentation for each project how to do that.
